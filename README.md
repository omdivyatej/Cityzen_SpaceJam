Our project deals with the problems faced by students who travel to a new city for college studies by providing them with guidance on local places of interest and needs, how they should conduct themselves with the locals and other crucial aspects of moving to a completely alien place. Ultimate purpose of the solution will be to save money.

Approach:
Our solution to the problem is in form of an app, developed using Android Studio. Opening the app, the user will be greeted to a Login Page where he can sign in to his account. We are maintaining user accounts database using Firebase to implement personalized recommendations for the user. 
•	After logging in, the user will see the homepage of the app from where he can access the different services/features the app has to offer.
•	That consists of forums where the user can interact with the locals who use the app.
•	Then comes the online food ordering service which will first gather list of local and small restaurants which aren’t under the areas of focus for apps like Swiggy, Zomato etc. and help the user order food from them and do a take-out.
•	Then comes the Local transport feature which will display all bus routes and timings and other various important travel mediums information. 
•	That follows the Language Help menu. We implement a table structure, first column of which will contain the important keywords of verbal communication in a specific language. The second column will have pre-recorded audio pronunciation of that word. The third column will have the English translation of the word.
•	The final feature (as of now) is of places of interest to visit. Our app will compile recommendations of local places to visit (as gathered by a google forms survey), their location, best times to visit and other important details according to the user’s interests.
Advantages of the solution:
•	Student friendly
•	Input directly from locals (through a google forms survey circulated among peers and mutual acquaintances) which might also include tricks and tips they use in their daily lives.
•	Q&A forum for direct communication between the local people and the user.
•	Let the user know of the local attractions (not in terms of places to visit only but so much more!) like places to eat which are not displayed by a simple Google search which only shows costly and premium restaurants and ignores the popular and delicious but less flashy local joints (like our very own Sutta Galli!!) etc.
Pitfalls of the solution:
•	It varies time to time and place to place so the app must be updated very regularly which might not keep up with the rate of changes.
•	For the online food ordering option, connecting and coordinating with the vendors presents as a challenge given internet and network constraints.
